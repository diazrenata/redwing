So I suspect overlap is maybe not the most sensitive metric for catching
either sizestructured replacement or nonrandom size shifts?

I.e. the absence of a signal does not mean it didnâ€™t happen.

Or, both types of dynamic can be happening within a single size
spectrum. In this case,

``` r
real <- all_smooths %>%
  filter(is.na(sim_seed))

ggplot(real, aes(mass, start)) + geom_line() + geom_line(aes(mass, end), linetype = 6)
```

  tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = sim_seed, names_from = timechunk, values_from= c("energy", "mean_biomass", "abundance")) %>%
  mutate(energy_change = (log(energy_end / energy_start)),
         mean_size_change = (log(mean_biomass_end / mean_biomass_start)),
         abundance_change = (log(abundance_end / abundance_start)))


ggplot(sv_change, aes((energy_change), fill = is.na(sim_seed))) + geom_density(data = filter(sv_change, !is.na(sim_seed))) + geom_vline(xintercept = (filter(sv_change, is.na(sim_seed))$energy_change[1]))

It just looks like a lot of this is not extraordinary given the species
pool.
