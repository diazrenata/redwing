ISDs overlap too much | species overlap about 20% of the time (compared
to 5% at random). No obvious relationship with distance (great-circle)
or domain-domain (but very few within-domain comparisons).

Maybe the similarity of sites along other axes? Maybe distance isnâ€™t
nuanced enough, maybe other environmental covariates.

A little creeped out by possible species richness effects, etc. Not sure
yet on the intuition there.
